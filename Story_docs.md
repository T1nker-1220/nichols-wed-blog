# Story Page Documentation

## Feature Overview
The Story page is currently implemented as a "Coming Soon" placeholder, designed to maintain the wedding theme's aesthetic while indicating that the full love story content is under development.

## Technical Details
- **Component Type**: Server Component (Next.js App Router)
- **Location**: `src/app/story/page.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: None (removed previous dependencies on story data)

### Component Structure
```tsx
- Metadata configuration
- Main container with gradient background
- Centered content layout
- Decorative texture overlay
```

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Maintains wedding theme colors:
  - Primary: `#8B4513` (Saddle Brown)
  - Secondary: `#A0522D` (Sienna)
  - Accent: `#CD853F` (Peru)
- Gradient backgrounds for visual depth
- Script font for headings
- Responsive text sizing

## Configuration
### Metadata
```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Our Story | Coming Soon",
  description: "Our love story is coming soon - stay tuned!"
};
```

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: Default styling
- Tablet (md): text-6xl for heading
- Desktop (lg): text-7xl for heading

## Usage Examples
The page is currently static and requires no interaction. When ready to implement the full story:
1. Restore the story data import
2. Implement the timeline component
3. Add interactive elements
4. Update metadata

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- Texture overlay not showing: Ensure the image exists at `/images/texture-overlay.png`
- Font not loading: Verify font-script class is properly configured in Tailwind

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal bundle size due to removed dependencies
- Static page with no client-side JavaScript
- Optimized background image loading

## Future Improvements
1. Add loading state for texture overlay
2. Implement smooth transitions for when full content is added
3. Consider adding a newsletter signup for updates
4. Plan for progressive enhancement of story timeline
