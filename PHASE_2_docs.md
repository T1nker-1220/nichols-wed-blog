```

### Image Optimization

- Next.js Image component
- Responsive sizes prop
- Object-fit: cover
- WebP format
- Lazy loading

### Animation System

```tsx
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
      delayChildren: 0.3,
    },
  },
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  show: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
};
```

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for images
- Minimal gap between items
- Optimized animations
- Pointer-events-none for decorative elements

## Accessibility

- Alt text for all images
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels where needed

## Mobile Responsiveness

- Adjusted spacing for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly hover states
- Preserved animations

## Future Enhancements
